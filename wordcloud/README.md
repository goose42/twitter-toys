**About:**<br>
  This is an application to query twitter for based on a search string and present<br>
  the most frequently used words in the form of a word cloud.<br>
<br>
**Usage:**<br>
  Once you download this folder, run the following:
  <br><br>
  *python word_cloud.py
  <br><br>
  You will be prompted for a query sting. This string will be used to search <br> 
  twitter for the most recent tweets.<br> 
  A word cloud will be created from these tweets as a png file, with the name output<timestamp>.png<br>
