**About:**<br>
  This is an application to query twitter for based on a search string and present<br>
  the most frequently used words in the form of a word cloud.<br>
<br>
**Usage:**<br>
  To search twitter you need to use 'search.py'. Simply type:<br>
    <br>>python search.py<br>
  You will be prompted for a search string and a file to output textual data from twitter.<br>
<br>
  Once you have the text file, you would need to use 'word_cloud.py'. Simply type:<br>
    <br>>python word_cloud.py<br>
  You will be prompted for a text file to parse. Please provide the same file you obtained<br>
  from the search. The word cloud will be created as a png file, with the name output<timestamp>.png<br>

  I wrote a bit more about what I've done with some examples, here: http://goosewrites.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/twitter-word-cloud/
